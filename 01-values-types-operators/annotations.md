# Values, Types and Operatos

There are six basic value types on JavaScript: number, string, boolean, object, function and undefined.

## Number

They are positive or negative numerical values, with or without decimal places; for very big or very small numbers, you can use scientific notation (e, for exponent - 2.998e8).

Numbers are also used for storing arithmetic expressions.

There are three special values that JavaScript considers numbers, but they doesn't look like them:

* Infinity: the positive infinity. For register, Infinity - 1 is still Infinity;
* -Infinity: the negative infinity;
* NaN: Not a Number. You can get this result in expressions divided by zero or expressions where you can't get an accurate number for an answer.
